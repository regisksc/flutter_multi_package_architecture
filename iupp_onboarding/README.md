# iupp_onboarding

A new flutter module project.

# Testing

**Here at Zup we strongly endorse the test culture.** 

We do not force tests to cover a predetermined amount of code coverage. We believe it is the responsibility of the developer to test the parts of the code that he thinks are important.

We expect from our contributors *unit tests*, *widget tests* and *integration tests*. 

To facilitate the test, there is a script inside the scripts directory, called `runTests.sh`, executing it is enough to run all the tests of the module in question. This script also generate code coverage statistics and this info is generated on the coverage folder. For the script to run properly you need to have `lcov` installed on your machine.
